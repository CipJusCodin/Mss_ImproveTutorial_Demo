# TUTORIAL TO DRAW SHAPES
The Video Shape Extractor is a command-line utility designed for extracting specific shapes from video files efficiently. It leverages the power of FFmpeg for video processing and extraction tasks.

This tool provides users with the ability to select from a range of five different shapes. After selecting a shape, the tool swiftly processes the video, extracting the chosen shape. Within seconds, the extracted video is presented to the user. The extracted video is saved locally for future reference and is automatically played for immediate review.

Users can conveniently exit the application at any time using the "esc" key, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.
